# Projects and Workshops

This is a collection of some of my academic projects and workshops I've hosted.

## Numerical Weather Prediction

A week-long SAMSI project where I worked with other undergraduates to implemement a localized LETKF for the Python package DATeS.

Here's the paper for the Kalman Filter and the website for DATeS:

* [Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter: An Efficient Scheme for Assimilating Atmospheric Data (John Harlim & Brian R. Hunt](https://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/pubs/harlim_hunt05.pdf)
* [DATeS](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~attia/DATeS/About.html)
