# Projects and Workshops

This is a collection of some of my academic projects and workshops I've hosted.

## NC PACE Infographic

I produced an infographic for the organization NC PACE. Something pretty as opposed to the super quantitative stuff from before.
Here's their website:

## Numerical Weather Prediction

A week-long SAMSI project where I worked with other undergraduates to implemement a localized LETKF for the Python package DATeS.
Here's the paper for the Kalman Filter and the website for DATeS:

* [Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter: An Efficient Scheme for Assimilating Atmospheric Data (Harlim & Hunt)](https://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ekalnay/pubs/harlim_hunt05.pdf)
* [DATeS](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~attia/DATeS/About.html)

## Regular Latin Squares

A summer-long Combinatorics REU where I (with much help of my advisor Carl Mummert) enumerated a family of latin squares and produced a lower bound for the number of mates that a latin square of a given size can have.
